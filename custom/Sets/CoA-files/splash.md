**<p style="text-align: center;">The cost of innovation has come due.</p>**

After eons of extracting natural resources to fuel the forges of Kaladesh's artificers, the environmental damage to the plane has become too much. However rampaging climate change is not the only factor driving political chaos. 
Avishkar has seen thousands of warriors, animals, monks, and even undescipherable figures immigrate across the planar bridge in hope of an esacpe from the dragon ravaged lands of Tarkir.

Avishkar residences have responded to these natural disasters and new neighbors in many different ways. Some have become activist anarchists letting despair and rage drive them to action, others deny the changes in the clime are happening and become captivated by the monastic orders of the newcomers. 
All the while, industrialists and financiers get rich exploiting the dwindling natural resources and lobbying the artificers who lead Kaladesh's ruling council.

##New Keywords

Changes of Avishkar comes with three new keywords:

**Manufacture:** The artificers of Kaladesh have ramped up production of their servos, thopters, and creative innvoations. Manufacture N works much like Fabricat N, giving the option between N Servo tokens and +1/+1 counters, except it is not limited to happening only when a creature ETBs but can be caused by spells, activated or triggered abilities.

**Stun:** Climate change isn't always about things getting hotter. Blizzards, coldsnaps, hailstorms, and other winter flurries have grown strong and stun unprepared residents of Avishkar. Stunning a creature means tapping it and then putting a stun counter on it. 

**Flicker:** Formalizing a commonly used word in magic. Flickering simply means exiling a permanent and then returning it to the battlefield under its owner's control.
