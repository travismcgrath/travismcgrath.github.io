**<p style="text-align: center;">The cost of innovation has come due.</p>**

After eons of extracting natural resources to fuel the forges of Avishkar's artificers, the environmental damage to the plane has become too much. Aether volcanoes, flash blizzards and noxious tornados have begun to occur regularly. 

One particularly intense aether eruption caused a rift in the plane itself. The energy burst caused the very fabric of Avishkar to reach through the multiverse and fuse to the Shifting Wastes of Tarkir. Across the sands poured thousands of warriors, merchants, monks, and other indecipherable figures fleeing the dragon ravaged lands of Tarkir.  

Avishkar residents have responded to these natural disasters and immigrants in many different ways. Some have become activist anarchists letting despair and rage drive them to action, others deny the changes in the climate are happening and withdraw from the cities in order to  fixate on the monastic orders brought from Tarkir by the newcomers. 
Meanwhile, industrialists and financiers get rich exploiting the dwindling natural resources and lobbying the artificers who lead Avishkar's ruling council.

##New Keywords

Changes of Avishkar comes with three new keywords:

**Manufacture:** The artificers of Avishkar have ramped up production of their servos, thopters, and creative innvoations. Manufacture N works much like Fabricate N, giving the option between N Servo tokens and +1/+1 counters, except it is not limited to happening only when a creature ETBs but can be caused by spells, activated or triggered abilities.

**Stun:** Climate change isn't always about things getting hotter. Blizzards, coldsnaps, hailstorms, and other winter flurries have grown strong and stun unprepared residents of Avishkar. Stunning a creature means tapping it and then putting a stun counter on it. 

**Flicker:** Formalizing a commonly used word in magic. Flickering simply means exiling a permanent and then returning it to the battlefield under its owner's control.


##Returning Mechanics

**Energy, Morph, Prowess, Raid**, and **Vehicles** all play leading roles in the Changes on Avishkar.

**Manifest, Flicker, Rebound, Proliferate**, and **Flashback**  make cameo appearances in the set.
